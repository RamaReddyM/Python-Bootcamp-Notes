What is Python?
Python is a High Level ,interpreted ,Dynamically typed, Object oriented Programming Language.
•High Level Programming Language:(human understandable language)
High Level programming Language is  used for writing programs or software which could be easy to use, understood by the humans and computer.
•Dynamically Typed Programming Language:
These are the languages that donot require any predefined data type for any variable as it is interpreted by machine itself at runtime.

•Interpreted Programming Language:( Line by Line)
         The Interpreter reads the source code Line by Line and execute each line as it is read.
   Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter:
     The compiler and Interpreter,both have similar work to perform.compiler and interpreter convert the source code(HLL)to Machine code(Understand by computer).
     Compiler scans the entire program first and translate it into machine code (or) compiler translates the entire code in single run.
     Interpreter Scans line by line program and convert into machine code(or)Interpreter translates the entire code in line by line.


History of python
Python was developed by Guido van rossam in 1989 while working at national research institute at Netherlands.
But officially python was made available to public in 1991.The official date of birth of python is: feb 20th 1991.
The name python was selected from TV show “the complete monthy python’s circus” which was broadcasted in BBC from 1969 to 1979.
Variables in Python
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Variables is a name that is  used to refer memory location.
In the memory location , we add label to register ,that label stores data/values.
In python variable do not need to be declared with any particular type because it is dynamically typed programming language.
Example program:
x=10
print(x) //output:10
print(type(x))//output:class<int>

Type Casting:
Type Casting is the method to convert the python variable datatype into a certain datatype in order to perform required operation by users.
•	Implicit type conversion
In python implicitly type conversion is automatically performed. During the implicit type conversion the user is not supposed to mention any specific data type during the conversion.
 x=10
print(“a={a} and data type={type(a)}”) 
output:
 a=10 and data type=<class ‘int’>
•	Explicit type conversion
   In this method, python needs user involvement to convert the variable datatype into the required data type.
x=5
print(x)  // 5
y=float(x)
print(y) //5.0
z=str(x) //convert int to str
print(z) //”5”
